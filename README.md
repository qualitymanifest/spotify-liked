Up until mid-2019, Spotify allowed you to view an alphabetically-sorted grid of all of the artists who you had liked songs from. For some reason this was changed so that you instead view them as a list, with one artist per line, based on who you listened to most recently. This creates a couple problems:

-   Artists who you haven't listened to recently end up further and further down the list, getting lost in the abyss.
-   Finding your liked songs for a particular artist is like finding a needle in a haystack.

The goal of this project is to create a way to navigate and play songs from your liked artists similar to the old grid.
